# Morse-Code-Activity-on-STM-32
The game is simple: answer a set of questions presented by the green LED in morse code. The questions range from mathematical problems to simple patterns. As for functionality, the software is built to present different sequences of light flashes, representing morse code, and to check if the input is correct. The hardware used in the project was the STM-32 Nucleo Board in which the LED light and the button components were operated. The software was built using the C programming language.

The Morse Code project is targeted towards educational facilities such as the science centre, intended as an instructional and entertaining product. Its main purpose is to educate the user on one of the most common and universal systems of encrypting communication.

Built-in software takes the given questions and converts it to morse code. It is expected to present these questions through an LED light, where a quick flicker represents a dot and a longer flash is a dash. For the inputs, users are to respond to the prompt by clicking the button and sending a morse code message. The product is required to decode this inputted message and signal whether the input was correct or not.
