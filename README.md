# Morse-Code-Activity-on-STM-32
The game is simple: answer a set of questions presented by the green LED in morse code. The questions range from mathematical problems to simple patterns. As for functionality, the software is built to present different sequences of light flashes, representing morse code, and to check if the input is correct. The hardware used in the project was the STM-32 Nucleo Board in which the LED light and the button components were operated.
